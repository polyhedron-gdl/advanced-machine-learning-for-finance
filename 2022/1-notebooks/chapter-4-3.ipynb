    "Classification is a primary form of text analysis and is widely used in a variety of domains and applications. The premise of classification is simple: given a categorical target variable, learn patterns that exist between instances composed of independent variables and their relationship to the target. Because the target is given ahead of time, classification is said to be supervised machine learning because a model can be trained to minimize error between predicted and actual categories in the training data. Once a classification model is fit, it assigns categorical labels to new instances based on the patterns detected during training.\n",

    "The machine learning process often combines a series of transformers on raw data, transforming the dataset each step of the way until it is passed to the fit method of a final estimator. Pipeline objects enable us to integrate a series of transformers that combine normalization, vectorization, and feature analysis into a single, well-defined mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a Pipeline is to chain together multiple estimators representing a fixed sequence of steps into a single unit. All estimators in the pipeline, except the last one, must be transformers — that is, implement the transform method, while the last estimator can be of any type, including predictive estimators. Pipelines provide convenience; fit and transform can be called for single inputs across multiple objects at once. Pipelines also provide a single interface for grid search of multiple estimators at once. Most importantly, pipelines provide operationalization of text models by coupling a vectorization methodology with a predictive model. Pipelines are constructed by describing a list of (key, value) pairs where the key is a string that names the step and the value is the estimator object. Pipelines can be created either by using the make_pipeline helper function, which automatically determines the names of the steps, or by specifying them directly. Generally, it is better to specify the steps directly to provide good user documentation, whereas make_pipeline is used more often for automatic pipeline construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a pipeline with sklearn we simply define the steps in the object I have called text_clf in the code below. We can then simply call fit on this object to train the model. The pipeline object can also be used to make predictions on new data."
